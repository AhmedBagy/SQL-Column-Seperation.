# SQL-Column-Seperation

It took me a while to find a way to efficiently seperate a column that had string like this "Ahmed,Mona,Wael,MO". So, I joined the table multiple times to itself then in SELECT,
I prompt to create column at each "," found. The result became as required. Ahmed in a single column and so do Mona ........

I hope anyone find this useful.
